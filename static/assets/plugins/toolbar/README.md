# Toolbar.js

A jQuery plugin that creates tooltip style toolbars.

## Update

Toolbar.js has been overhauled with new functionality, a completely new design and now makes use of [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) project as the base for icons.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation for the toolbar at the [toolbar project page][projectpage]. This is the best source for documentation as it will be updated as new features are released.
